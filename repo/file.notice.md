# File

This extension reads local files from disk.

- **IMPORTANT**: This extension can display arbitrary files, and any page can link to any file on your computer using this extension, but that does not mean the file ever leaves your device, and no-one has access to files on your computer except you - this simply allows people to show you the contents of a file on your device.

## Dependencies

- None
