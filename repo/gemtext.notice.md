# Gemtext

An extension for pages hosted with the gemini protocol.

- Translates gemtext documents into ILM, for better viewing in an ILM viewer
- Handles actual ILM documents hosted on gemini strangely, just use the gemini extension for that!

## Dependencies

- `openssl` (almost certainly installed already)

Proceed (y/N)
